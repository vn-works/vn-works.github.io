      1.0 The Information That We Collect and The Purposes for Which It is
      Collected
    </h3>
    <p>There are two general categories of information we will process:</p>

    <h4>1.1 Information that You Submit</h4>
    <p>
      To use some of the functionality of the Software, you may voluntarily
      permit us to access the camera or photo album to obtain photos on your
      mobile device. We access your camera and/or photo album only if you
      confirm your permission. When you use the Future Baby Face Generator in
      the Software, we will capture the position and shape of the six sense
      organs in the photos of your face, analyze the facial features
      information, and give feedback on the effect drawing or conclusion to you.
      For such photos, facial features information, effect drawing, conclusion,
      and feedback result, we will neither store nor share them with any third
      parties after analysis. Please do not require this Software to process
      content that may directly or indirectly disclose any personal information.
    </p>

    <h4> Collection and processing of your facial features information: </h4>
    <p> When  you  use  Baby  Generator  features  of  the  Software  to  process  your  facial  photos,  we  will  analyze  the  Face  Data,  recognize  the  position  and  shape  of  the  five  sense  organs,  and  gender  in  the  photos,  then  process them, and feedback the special effect photos to you. 
 If  you  cease  to  consent  or  affirmatively  revoke  consent  for  our  collection  and  processing  of  your  facial  features information, we will promptly cease all such collection and processing. 
 Due  to  the  limited  processing  resources  available  on  mobile  devices,  we  use  a  cloud  server  to  process  these  images.  Images  remain  in  the  cloud  for  a  limited  period  of  24  hours,  after  which  all  photos  are  deleted from the cloud. 
</p>

    <h4> The purposes we collect your facial features information: </h4>

    <p> For  such  facial  photos,  facial  features  information  and  special  effect  photos,  we  will  neither  store  in  our  server nor share them with any third parties after processing. </p>

    <p> To  ensure  that  you  may  save  photos  or  cache  information  normally  to  your  device,  you  may  voluntarily  grant us the permission to access to the storage of your device. 
 Our  purpose  in  accessing  the  camera  is  to  use  the  functionality  of  the  camera  to  take  pictures  following  our instructions. 
 Our  aim  to  reach  the  photo  album  is  to  recognize  the  position  and  shape  of  your  five  sense  organs  by  following your instructions in your chosen face photo.
